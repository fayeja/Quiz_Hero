                    <td>What's the difference between local storage,section storage ,cookies?</td>
                    <td>
                        <li>localStorage is a method of storing data on the computer of the client. It allows key/value pairs to be <br> saved in a web browser and stores data with no expiration date. JavaScript and HTML5 are the only ways <br> to access localStorage. However, the user can clear the browser data/cache to delete all localStorage data.</li>
                        <li>Section storage only stores data for a single session, which means it is only saved until the browser (or tab) <br> is closed. Data is never sent to the server and can only be read on the client side.</li>
                        <li>Cookies are generally for server-side reading (although can also be read on the client site), whereas <br> localStorage and sessionStorage are usually read on the client. Data that must be given back to the server with <br> subsequent XHR requests is saved here. Its expiration time varies depending on the kind, and the length can be <br> defined either server-side or client-side.</li>

                    <td>What is event loop and how does it work?</td>
                    <td>Calling setTimeout causes the web API to execute, which adds the callback to the callback queue. The event loop <br> then removes the callback from the queue and adds it to the stack as soon as it is empty. There are several <br> activities going on at the same time here.</td>

                    <th>4</th>
                    <td>how does quizTimer() function work?</td>
                    <td>quizTimer() is a function that sets the timer during quiz time. When a user clicks the submit button, the timer is <br> stopped(dismissed). Generally, it begins at the end of the countdown and continues until the submit button is <br> clicked. The function divides the timer into two parts: minute and second. After 1000ms, the time changes. </td>

                    <th>5</th>
                    <td>how does chooseQuiz() function work?</td>
                    <td>chooseQuiz() is a function that takes two parameters: the quiz index number and the quiz result. Then the find <br> function  is used to compare the quiz result to the given answer of JSON file. If the answer does not match, it <br> returns the given answer, correct answer as well as some answer-related data. The quiz's serial number is <br> increased as well.If the answer is a match, the answer is also returned. Lastly, the chooseQuiz() function displays <br> the quiz answers via the displayAnswers() function.</td>
